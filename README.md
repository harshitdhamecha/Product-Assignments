### Product Development (Happiest Minds Internship):

- Despite joining in as a JAVA developer, I had to shift into the Web Development sector withing a week due to lack of projects in JAVA. There I learnt multiple new technologies from scratch within 2 weeks and implemented them along the way to create a product for a **multi-billion dollar automotive organization**. Some technologies I worked upon were **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MySQL and Figma**. While my tenure was not enough to provide with a full fledged product, I was able to set the base for the product application and get the team approval in one of the sprints (it was an **Agile scrum development**).
